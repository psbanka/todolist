To do list
==========

This is something of a learning project that we are working on as a part of 
[Code Scouts](http://codescouts.org). Our list of todos for the todo app are currently:

 * Build a static HTML form for the to-do list itself. (Andrea)
 * Build a node.js login screen (Peter)
 * Build a JSON API for saving and retreiving to-do list items (Peter)
